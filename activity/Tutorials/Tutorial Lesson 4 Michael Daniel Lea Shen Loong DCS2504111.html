<br>
<hr noshade color=mediumspringgreen>
<br>
<p><textcolor=black> A <em><b><big> shepherd</em></b></big> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields<br> near the forest. He felt his job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> One day, while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying<br> away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but <br> didn't find any wolf.</p> 
<br> 
<br>
<p> The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun, There is no wolf here". <i><b><big> The boy<br> played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</i></b></big>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,<br> suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.<br> The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf!<strike> The wolf is carring a<br> lamb away!"</strike>
<br>
<p><span style=color:purple><big> The farmers <sup> thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief </sub> again.</big></span><span style=color:black> So, no one paid<br> attention to him and didn't come to his help.</span>
